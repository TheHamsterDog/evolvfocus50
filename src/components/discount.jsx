                Why such a massive discount?
            </h2>
            <p> We want the program to be affordable to everyone including college students, school dropouts, or homemakers who are passionate about transforming their life and are looking for direction. Our target is to positively impact 100,000 lives this year.</p>
            <p>
                Moreover, our true reward is hundreds of emails received each week from our students ( Entrepreneurs, Working professionals, Consultants, Students) mentioning the many-fold growth our course has brought in their life. This makes it worth all the effort our team has put in building this course.
